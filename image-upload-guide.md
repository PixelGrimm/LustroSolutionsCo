# Image Upload Guide for Before & After Photos

## üñºÔ∏è **How to Add Your Real Before & After Photos**

Since I can't directly upload images to your website, here are the best ways to add your actual cleaning photos:

### **Option 1: Use Cloudinary (Recommended)**
1. **Sign up** at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com) (free tier available)
2. **Upload your photos** to Cloudinary
3. **Get the URLs** for each image
4. **Replace the image URLs** in the HTML

### **Option 2: Use GitHub (Free)**
1. **Create a folder** in your GitHub repository called `images/`
2. **Upload your photos** to this folder
3. **Use GitHub's raw URLs** for the images

### **Option 3: Use Railway Static Files**
1. **Create an `images/` folder** in your project
2. **Add your photos** to this folder
3. **Reference them** as `/images/photo-name.jpg`

## üì∏ **Photos You Want to Add:**

Based on your images, here are the before/after pairs you should upload:
