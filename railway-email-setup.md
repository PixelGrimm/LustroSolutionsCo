# Railway Email Setup Guide

## Current Status
Your quote form is working but emails are not being sent because Railway doesn't have SMTP configured.

## Current Solution
The form currently simulates email success on Railway so users get confirmation messages, but actual emails aren't sent.

## Why This Happens
Railway doesn't have SMTP configured by default, so PHP's `mail()` function doesn't work.

## Solutions for Real Email

### Option 1: Use Railway's Email Service (Recommended)
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click "New" → "Service" → "Email"
3. Connect your domain email (`info@lustrosolutions.co.uk`)
4. Update code to use Railway's email API

### Option 2: Configure External SMTP
1. Sign up for SendGrid, Mailgun, or similar
2. Get API key
3. Update Railway variables with SMTP credentials
4. Implement proper email library (PHPMailer, etc.)

### Option 3: Use Email API Service
1. Sign up for Resend, Postmark, or similar
2. Get API key
3. Update code to use their REST API
4. No SMTP configuration needed

## Current Railway Variables
```
RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
SMTP_HOST=mail.spacemail.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_USERNAME=info@lustrosolutions.co.uk
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-spacemail-password
SMTP_ENCRYPTION=ssl

## Next Steps

2. **Short-term**: Choose email solution from above
3. **Long-term**: Implement real email functionality

## Status Summary
